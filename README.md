# TTD

***~~Time Till Death~~
Treat Triage Diagnose***

## About

TTD is a game about running an underpriveleged medical clinic.
The government has allocated you enough resources to treat 10 patients.
However, you have 15 per turn. Who will you treat?

## Mechanics

There are 3 essential core game mechanics.

#### Diagnose

By default, you get 3 symptoms from a patient. Diagnosing will give you 2 more symptoms.
Diagnosing will take up a small portion of your resources. Choose carefully: if you diagnose everyone,
you may not have enough resources to treat many patients! Diagnosing a patient helps you
to triage them.

#### Triage

Triaging is choosing what priority you will give each patient. In this game, triaging refers to
how much resources you will allocate to each patient, and in which order they will be treated.
Be careful: patients who are deathly ill may die before they are treated!

#### Treat
Treating a patient is the act of curing a patient of their ailments. Treating takes the most of your
resources. Treated patients may not always survive, however you can allocate more resources to a 
patient to increase their chances of survival. You have enough resources to treat 10 patients
standardly.
